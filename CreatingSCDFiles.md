# Creating SCDs:


You can use SCDToolkit to create SCDs and add loop points to tracks.
SCDs can be created from most audio formats, but **only wav and SCD are able to use the loop editor.**
 

 
**Step 1: Download**

- Download SCDToolkit [here](https://github.com/skylect-dev/SCDToolkit2/releases/latest).


**Step 2: Extract and Setup**

- Extract the download to a location of your choice and run SCDToolkit.exe.


**Step 3: Adding Audio**

- Click the Add Folder button in the Audio Library section, near the top, and select any folders (or parent folder) with your audio files. Most formats are supported.

    - You may add as many folders and audio files as you wish but note that the more files the app must scan, the longer it could take to load in the future.


**Step 4: Converting to SCD**

Now you should have the Audio Library populated, and media will be listed in the Audio Files section below.

- Select one or more files to convert and click Convert Selected to SCD.

- Choose the quality of the conversion.

- Confirm the selection to be converted and choose the location to save the SCD(s) to.

**Congratulations! You now have some fresh SCD files.
Use the Loop Editor on the SCDs you have, to add or edit loop points.**
